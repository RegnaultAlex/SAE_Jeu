In a ravaging world where the sand has covered cities and hopes, water is the most precious resource. A legend tells of a lost city buried under the dunes that hides a machine capable of bringing life back to Earth. However, the dunes are not only a quiet desert: it is full of terrible sand dunes, supernatural creatures and unscrupulous bandits.

You play as a young adventurer with a map fragment leading to this city. 
Warning: each choice could lead you to the success, or your own end.
